As part of the data cleaning process in Excel, I carried out several steps to prepare the dataset for analysis. I began by replacing missing values in the director column with the placeholder “Unknown” to handle blank entries consistently. To clean text fields, I used the REPLACE function to eliminate unwanted spaces. I removed duplicate rows using Excel’s Remove Duplicates feature to ensure data integrity. Column headers such as country, name, and others were standardized by converting them to lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores for uniformity. Additionally, I formatted all date values to follow the dd-mm-yyyy format, and further converted them into full datetime values by appending time using Excel formulas, displayed as dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm. These cleaning steps improved the consistency, readability, and overall quality of the dataset.
